## Data structures and algorithms

### Basic data structures

Describe how data could be organized from the programming language perspective.

1. Linear data structures (arrays, dictionaries, linked lists, stack, queue, set)
2. Non-linear (trees)
3. Operations costs

### Basic algorithms

Manipulate data represented via some data structure. Transform data.

1. Traversal
2. Search
3. Sort

### Advanced data structures

More specific approach to store data that responds to particular set of problems.

1. BST, colored trees, tries
2. Heaps
3. Streams
4. Immutable approach to data structures
5. Others

### Advanced algorithms

More specific approach to manipulate data.

## Mathematics for programmers

### Mathematical logic

* notation, syntax 
* semantics
* deduction, rules of inference
* equality and its axioms

### Boolean algebra

* logic operations: conjunction, disjunction, equality, implication, negation, exclusive or
* De Morgan laws

### Set theory

* concepts
* notation
* definition of cardinality
* cartesian product
* definition of class
* empty set, subset, relation, projection, union, intersection

### Abstract algebra

* definitions for unary operation, binary operation
* definitions for set, grupoid, semigroup, monoid, group, ring, field, algebra

### Number theory

* Natural, integer, rational, real numbers
* Integer numbers in Computer Science
* Real numbers in Computer Science
* Floating point and fixed point numbers representation

### Graph theory

* notation
* types of graphs
* traversal
* cyclic and acyclic graph
